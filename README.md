# simple-kana-keyboard
Android simple Japanese keyboard including only Kana. It is intended to be useful only for japanese beginner learners.


## Intent

I publish this project in case it could be of any use to someone, but most likely it is only handy to me.

On the first stages of learning japanese, a student won't use many Kanji (chinese-like characters) but kana. Kana signs are present in combination with kanji in real language and is also a means to write when learning, since it represent a phonetic transcription.

I was not happy with a keyboard I had installed in my android smart phone since some kana combinations were not too easy to produce, on the other hand there were so many options (due to kanji support) that were distracting me, so I though I would be able to type faster if I had a keyboard that only included what I needed.

There are plenty of options in google play, but I don't like the warning that the system produces when you install and activate a new keyboard. It says something on the line of "Be wary, this app could have access to the passwords or sensitive info you write". 

This is a simple app. It doesn't require any permission since it is completelly stateless and obviouslly the code is published so it can be audited in order to check it is safety.

You can learn more about kana in the following link.

Another possibility for you landing here is if you are interested in how to develop a keyboard for android. Feel free to browse the code, but I'd suggest the following article instead which was helpful to me:

It is well explained and it creates a keyboard much like the one most westerners are used to.

## Installation
Following the idea on not having to trust someone you don't know I don't provide packages, so it would be do-it-yourself style. 

Installing android studio, getting the code and building the apk would get you the package to be installed in your device. Then, you have to get it in your device and probably change your settings (temporarilly) to allow installing unsigned apks. Finally, you'll have to enable your new keyboard in settings once it is already installed.

## Status
**WARNING:** Work in progress. Very first version implemented. I'd say this is an alpha version.
